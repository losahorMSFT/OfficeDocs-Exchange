# Exchange Server system requirements

::: moniker range="exchserver-2019"
Before you install Exchange Server 2019, we recommend that you review this topic to ensure your network, hardware, software, clients, and other elements meet the requirements for Exchange 2019. Also, make sure you understand the coexistence scenarios that are supported for Exchange 2019 and earlier versions of Exchange.

To actually install Exchange 2019, see [Deploy new installations of Exchange](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/plan-and-deploy/deploy-new-installations/deploy-new-installations?view=exchserver-2019).

## Supported coexistence scenarios for Exchange 2019

The supported coexistence scenarios between Exchange 2019 and earlier versions of Exchange are described in the following table:

|**Exchange version**|**Exchange 2019 organization coexistence**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Exchange 2010 and earlier versions|Not supported|
|Exchange 2013|Supported with Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 21 (CU21) or later on all Exchange 2013 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.|
|Exchange 2016|Supported with Exchange 2016 CU11 or later on all Exchange 2016 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.
|Mixed Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016 organization|Supported if all Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016 servers in the organization meet the requirements as previously described in this table.|

## Supported hybrid deployment scenarios for Exchange 2019

Exchange 2019 supports hybrid deployments with Office 365 tenants that have been upgraded to the latest version of Office 365. For more information about specific hybrid deployments, see [Hybrid deployment prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/hybrid-deployment-prerequisites).

## Network and directory server requirements for Exchange 2019

The requirements for the network and the directory servers in your Exchange 2019 organization are described in the following table:

|**Component**|**Requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Domain controllers|All domain controllers in the forest need to be running one of the following versions of Windows Server: <br/>• Windows Server 2019 Standard or Datacenter <br/>• Windows Server 2016 Standard or Datacenter <br/>• Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard or Datacenter|
|Active Directory forest|The Active Directory forest functional level is **Windows Server 2012 R2** or higher.|
|Active Directory site|The Active Directory site where you install the Exchange Server must contain at least one writeable domain controller that's also a global catalog server, or the installation will fail. Furthermore, you can't install the Exchange server and then remove the domain controller from the Active Directory site.|
|DNS namespace|Exchange 2019 supports the following DNS namespaces:  <br/> • Contiguous  <br/> • Noncontiguous  <br/> • Single label domains  <br/> • Disjoint  <br/> For more information about DNS namespaces that are supported by Exchange, see [KB2269838](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=2269838).|
|IPv6|Exchange 2013 and later support IPv6 only when IPv4 is also installed and enabled on the Exchange server. <br/> If you deploy Exchange in this configuration, and your network supports IPv4 and IPv6, all Exchange servers can send data to and receive data from devices, servers, and clients that use IPv6 addresses. For more information, see [IPv6 Support in Exchange 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/33543023-eb9a-4102-b990-84a818a52814.aspx).|

## Directory server architecture for Exchange 2019

Active Directory domain controllers on 64-bit hardware with a 64-bit version of Windows Server will increase directory service performance for Exchange 2019.

### Installing Exchange 2019 on directory servers

For security and performance reasons, we don't recommend installing Exchange 2019 on Active Directory directory servers. Only install Exchange 2019 on member servers.

To learn more about the issues that you'll encounter when you install Exchange on a directory server, see [Installing Exchange on a domain controller is not recommended [WarningInstallExchangeRolesOnDomainController]](../plan-and-deploy/deployment-ref/ms-exch-setupreadiness-warninginstallexchangerolesondomaincontroller.md). After Exchange is installed, changing the server role from a member server to a directory server or vice-versa isn't supported.

## Exchange third-party clients

Exchange Server offers several well-known protocols, and publishes APIs that third-party vendors often write clients for.

Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, as to the overall suitability, fitness, compatibility, or security of clients that are created by third-party developers.

If you want to use a third-party client that uses our protocols or APIs, we recommend that you thoroughly review and test all considerations (functionality, security, maintenance, management, and so on) before you deploy the client in the enterprise workspace. We also recommend that you make sure that the third-party vendor offers an appropriate Enterprise Support Agreement (ESA).
